## 📌 Overview
The **Voice Spectrum Analyzer** is a MATLAB-based app designed to record, visualize, and analyze voice signals in both the time and frequency domains. Users can capture real-time audio and explore its **Amplitude, Phase, and Energy** spectra using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

## ✨ Features
- 🎙️ **Real-time voice recording**
- 📈 **Time-domain signal visualization**
- 📊 **Frequency-domain analysis using FFT**
- 🔄 **Supports multiple spectrum types**:
  - Amplitude Spectrum
  - Phase Spectrum
  - Energy Spectrum
- 🛠️ **Interactive controls**: Zoom & Pan enabled for detailed analysis
